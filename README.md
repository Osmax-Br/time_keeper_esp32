# time_keeper_esp32
one of my biggest projects using esp32

now you can read the following to understand more about its features and why I created this

I think you had that time when you are very distarcted and you cannot focus , or you just like to log your activities and how much you spent on them 
,for example I like to log that I spent today 3 hours studying math and 2 hours studying arabic and 7 hours sleeping

I know that it seems very nerd(y)-stuff , but I actually didnt find anything like that so I decided to make my own

first of all I used an esp32,oled screen,keypad,ir reciver and some minor stuff
